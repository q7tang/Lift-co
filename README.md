# Lift-co
Lift&amp;co Data Challenge\n
I used MySQL to store the dataset downloaded from Yelp, and solved Section 1.2 using a MySQL query.\n
The MySQL code and result for Section 1.2 are included in 'section1.2.png'\n
I connected Python to the datastore and performed analysis using Python since Section 1.3.\n
The Python codes and results for Section 1.3-2.2 are included in lift&co.ipynb.
